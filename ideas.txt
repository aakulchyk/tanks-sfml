Main idea: crossover of Battle City and Vampire Survivors

Gameplay:

Survive waves of enemy tanks while protecting your base!


Base mechanics like in original Battle City game:
- 4 directions
- shot speed depends on how many bullets are currently in air
- player protects base ("eagle" surrounded by destroyable walls)
- enemies move randomly (mostly)
- two players can play cooperatively (in furure versions)
- 2 colliding bullets cancel each other

Initial state:
- 3 lives
- base speed
- base bullet speed
- only one bullet can be shot
- base surrounded by one layer of bricks
- base is destroyed by a single shot

game rules:
- player spawns on stage near to the base (eagle surrounded by bricks)
- player is invincible for 5 seconds
- there are several enemy spawn points on the map. some are open from beginning, some open after some time
- player needs to survive on the map for some time (5-10 min)
- spawn rate and enemy powers increase with time
- [optional] the can be a boss in the end of the level
- every killed enemy leaves piece of XP. amount depends on the tank type
- player needs to collect XP to gain it
- on level up player can choose one of 3 random upgrades
- upgrades can be: tank upgrades (1-4 levels), base upgrades (1-4 levels), one time bonuses
- when losing a life, player loses all XP and tank upgrades (but not the base upgrades!)
- base can be destroyed by friendly fire!


Upgrade ideas:

- TANK LEVELING
    1) faster bullet (up to x4)
    2) more simultaneous bullets (up to 4)
    3) faster tank (up to x3)
    4) powerful bullets (up to x4) (on max level bullets can destroy concrete walls)
    5) additional protection (up to 4) (survide bullets without losing a life)
    6) XP attracting circle (up to 4 tiles)
    7) modern machinery (lvl 1-4) - makes all one time bonuses more effective
    8) rocket (explosive) - when rocket hits something, it explodes with bigger hitbox, which can kill enemies (but the base too!)
    9) improved optics - can see invisible tanks
    10) piercing bullet  (1 level) - synergy of 1 and 4 - when powerful bullet kills weak enemy, it loses part of its power, but continues to fly
    11) splitting bullet (1 level) - synergy of 4 and 8 - when exploded, bullet splits in two (with half power) bullets flying in opposite directions

- BASE LEVELING
    1) can survive more hits (up to 4)
    2) [!] sacrifice  - restore the base with the walls at the cost of 1 life (once, twice, depending on level)
    3) can rebuild wall once per X seconds (60, 45, 30, 15)
    4) can restore 1 hp if not shot during {20, 15, 10} seconds (depends on upgrade 1)
    5) reflecting bullets - requires at least 1 level of 1)


- INSTANT BONUSES
    1) freeze all enemies (10/15/20/25 sec)
    2) kill every enemy with 50/75/90/100% probability
    3) make base walls concrete for some time (15/20/30/45 sec )
    4) make player invincible for some time (10/15/20/30 sec)
    5) additional life (+1 in machinery level > 2)
    6) build random walls on the map (not near the base)
    7) kills everything near the base (4/6/8/10 tiles)
    8) collect all free XP at once

Enemy ideas

1) basic tank (std speed, std bullet speed, shots one bullet) - 100 pt
2) fast tank (fast speed, normal bullets) - 200pt
3) armor tank (slow speed, 3 hp) - 400pt
4) power tank (fast bullets) - 300pt
5) miner tank (fast speed, leaves landmines which explodes on player collision) - 500pt
6) vampire tank (can kill other tanks, increases hp on every kill) - 200pt * hp
7) invisible tank (only bullets are seen - improved optics skill makes it visible) - 600pt

Bonus Tanks

any tank randomly can be a bonus tank - when killed, droppes a loot box
box, when opened, provides one random upgrade



BOSS ideas

- super armor tank - takes 4 tiles, slow speed, 2 muzzles, shots 2 parallel bullets, which can destroy concrete. A lot of HP (10-20?)
